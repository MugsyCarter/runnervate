1871-11-01 San Francisco Bulletin p1c2","Begins with ""A quarrel and an attempt at murder, between the Celestials [Chinese] themselves, led to the interference of the civil authority, when, in an attempted arrest by an officer, the Chinese fatally shot an unoffending citizen called to his assistance, the officer himself barely escaping with his life, and a boy being wounded in the leg."" Citizens heard the rumor, ""banding themselves together to take summary vengeance for the death of the white man."" Chinese quarter ""besieged, and shots exchanged on both sides, and it would appear from our dispatches that two Chinamen and a Chinawoman were shot. In addition, fifteen Chinamen were captured and summarily executed."" Others were taken to jail. Author of report condemns vengeance, saying it ""was far in excess of the original offense,"" that the law likely would've taken care of it. ""In no part of the State have the courts erred on the side of clemency to the Chinese, and this being the case, the wholesale, indiscriminate lynching resorted to at Los Angeles is especially to be regretted, and is sure to be regarded abroad as an evidence of a rude state of society, and thus to bring reproach upon the State.""

10-27 gives more details of ""Brutal and Cowardly Atrocities"" committed by mob and initial crime committed by Chinese. ""Wholesale pillaging"" occurred at the scene of the riot ""on Negro alley,"" which is apparently the Chinese quarter. Random and accused members of the Chinese community robbed of valuables. ""Eighteen Chinamen were buried yesterday."" Describes ""ghastly and horrible sight"" of their bodies, mutilated, ""riddled with bullets,"" and stripped of clothing. Notes ""The ropes by which they were hanged were still attached to their necks, and a number of them were shot previous to being hanged."" Author suggests there was a threat a riot would occur at the burial as well, but it didn't. Inquest is ongoing. Author notes that ""Three of the four Chinamen who are said to have done the shooting at citizens and officers are still at large, only one of those hanged is known to have been a party to the shooting.""

10-27 goes into great detail about the fight between factions of Chinese that led to the ""attempt at murder"" and mass-lynching referred to in other articles. Also provides detail about shooting and hanging of Chinese associated with fight. Reporter states, ""Most of the whites engaged in the hanging were men of Hibernian extraction,"" and also notes that young men and teenagers made up a good portion of the lynch mob. Details ransacking of ""Negro Alley"" where Chinese live. ""It is believed that the majority of those lynched were innocent of the crime for which they suffered, and that most of the guilty ones had escaped during or after the time of the riot. But retribution is now likely to fall on the heads of the guilty; or, at least, the shadows of its coming are being cast around them. Yo Hing, the shooter of officer Bilderrain[?], is in jail, and two Americans are also abiding in the same place"" for their participation in the pillaging. Reporter details legal proceedings after lynchings. ""A special Grand Jury has been ordered by the County Judge, and those now under arrest will be indicted to appear before it.""
